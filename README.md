Professional PvZ Data Modification Tool.

## How to use ?

1. download exe and environment.zip
2. uncompress environment.zip to D:/SPCUtil folder
3. move exe file to D:/SPCUtil folder.
4. drag file at exe, then open it. (like .rton .json .rsbp .rsb .obb .pam or other)
5. select a option by number, then enter, then, you can see output file.

## What can we do ?

1. encode and decode RTON file
2. unpack and pack RES-PACKAGE : PAK & DZ file(in PvZ-1), RSGP(some player call it 'pgsr') & RSB(or OBB in android and RSB.SMF in Chinese version) file(in PvZ-2).
3. decode PAM Animate file, then view it by SPCUtil-AnimViewer.
4. other..... many many.
